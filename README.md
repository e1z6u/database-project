# Title
## Notes Application


# Description

***Primary Functionality:*** Notes
CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.

Our web application is a notes management platform that allows users to  create, organize, and edit their notes. 

***Secondary Functionality***
Organizing the notes in a certain group so that it could be easy for reading and revising our notes.

Our application creates a platform to write notes in a computer that we carry everysingle day to revise the notes for future reference. It would have an option of signing in so that the user could access the notes in the future. After the user adds his/her notes the note is either stored in the cloud or in the local storage of the user.

***User Registration,Authentication and Authorization***
Any user is going to be allowed to use the application without signing in a single device. If the user signs in his/her notes will be stored in the database as well as the neccessary information needed to authenticate the user. Unless the user logs out or application data is cleared the key used in authorixation will be acquired once upon successful authentication.

## Role Assignment

Since the primary functionality is all realted to notes of a user. We would have a user. There is also an admin which would be accessing the all users along with their notes and catagories of notes(Folders).
